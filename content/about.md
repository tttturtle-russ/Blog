## Hi there ,I'm TurtleRuss👋
### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me
I'm a senior student majoring in Cyberspace Security and Engieering in [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.cn). I'm advised by [Prof. Dongliang Mu](https://mudongliang.github.io/about/) and [Prof. Bin Yuan](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/yuanbin12/zh_CN/index.htm). During early time of 2024, I was an intern in University of Wisconsin, Madison, advised by [Prof. Chaowei Xiao](https://xiaocw11.github.io/) and working with his Ph.D student [Fangzhou Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KDYZnvEAAAAJ&hl=en). Now I'm a research assistant in HKUST working with [Prof. Dongdong She](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~dongdong/) and Qiao Zhang. 

Now I'm:

- 🤖 &nbsp; Studying LLVM and exploring how to use LLM more effectively.
- 🤔 &nbsp; Using LLM-assisted techniques to improve the performance of traditional software analyze tools.
- 🎓 &nbsp; Pursuing a Ph.D offer to continue(or start) my academic career.
